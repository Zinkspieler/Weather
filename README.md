# Weather

This app has been a running project for me to practice various elements of iOS programming as I have learned them. I started out thinking that I would just make a simple, single-view app for displaying the results of an API call, but it naturally grew
as I thought of more features I wanted it to have.
Among other things, this has solidified my understanding of Core Location, URLSession, parsing JSON data and restructuring it
into a form that makes sense for my app, UIAlertControllers, MapKit, UISearchControllers, swipe gestures, passing information between view controllers using delegate protocols and unwind segues, persisting data, and configuring table views.
